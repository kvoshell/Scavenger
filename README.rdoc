== Scavenger

Scavenger is an online bookmark tool that allows users to manage, share, and like bookmarks.
Bookmarks, along with a short description, can be added for virtually any website.  Bookmarks are
organized by topic, and users can browse and 'like' bookmarks posted by other users, as well as view these 'likes'
in an organized and easy to access manner.

Scavenger was built with Ruby on Rails and lives at https://scavenger-chicago.herokuapp.com/
